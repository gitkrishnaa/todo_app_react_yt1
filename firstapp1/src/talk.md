noe working on useContext 
before this implement todo list with random data

working on css on list reander of data

# so list render sucessful
now connecting add button and show data in list
 
 i am using useContext, but threre in many way to do this

 so context working fine 
 now just render context data into list

 so everythig workig fine
 
 now working on input clear when add button clicked;

 # deleet button
 working on delete button
 so i am geting id of respective 
 button,
 logic-
 and since id will tell nth of array
 where todo data is stored
